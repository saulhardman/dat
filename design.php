        <p><strong>The evolution of digital technologies and their applications, such as ‘Social Media’, the ‘Internet of Things’, augmented reality, virtual worlds, wearable and physical computing is explored in all the creative, design and production aspects.</strong></p>

        <p>The course combines creative and technical skills with cultural and new media theory - producing graduates who are highly employable while also seeing the world in a new way.</p>

        <p>We aim to future-proof our students, to prepare them for an ever-changing world, where technologies evolve, but smart thinking is always in demand.</p>
