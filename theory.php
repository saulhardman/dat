        <p><strong>On Digital Art and Technology, we underpin technical and creative skills with a theoretical framework ranging from the ideas of Bruce Sterling and Marshall McLuhan to Will Wright and Steve Jobs, and everything in-between.</strong></p>

        <p>Students learn a range of skills that allow them to deal with questions about media, technology and the future in a highly informed and critical way - our studies take in everything from cutting edge questions in digital culture -  to the archeologies of media forms. This allows us to reflect on the transformative power of technology as well as the way in which artists, individuals and the public have explored, exploited, innovated and intervened in the emergence of new technologies and digital media technologies.</p>
